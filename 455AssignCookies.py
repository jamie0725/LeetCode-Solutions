"""
Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
But, you should give each child at most one cookie. 
Each child i has a greed factor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content with; 
and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to the child i, and the child i will be content. 
Your goal is to maximize the number of your content children and output the maximum number.

Note:
You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
